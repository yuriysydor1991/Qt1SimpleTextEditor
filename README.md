```
And **voil√†!** You have executable under the build directory.

# Running the executable

To find and run the executable run next commands:

```
# to find the executable under the source/build tree
find . -name 'Qt1SimpleTextEditorDemo'

# example of the text editor executable dislocation
./build/src/Qt1SimpleTextEditorDemo
```

Don't forget to build it as in previous section shown.

# Generating documentation

Ensure that there are required Doxygen and Graphviz packages in your system:

```
sudo apt-get install -y doxygen graphviz
```

To generate Doxygen documentation execute the following commands:

```
mkdir -vp build && cd build && cmake ../ && cmake --build . --target Doxygen-doc
```

Under the build directory there will be created among others the "html" directory with index.html.

# Running cppcheck

## Installing cppcheck 

Ensure that cppcheck tools is installed in your system. If not, install it with help of a command (for Debian and descendants):

```
sudo apt-get install -y cppcheck
```

## Running all available checks

To run project wide checks with help of cppcheck, execute next command:
